We are all coming in at different levels and I would strongly suggest for the group projects that the pairing be determined by staff such that one group isn't composed of all the most technically proficient students or vice versa. I realize and appreciate that we are all bringing different skills to the table but being realistic, a huge part of this is being able to produce functioning code. My optimal learning is when working with someone who knows a little bit more than me, but don't feel I'm yet proficient enough to be teaching anything super useful to anyone who knows a little bit less than me, and I feel really badly when that happens.

I had an extremely productive Thursday, coding wise. I think that I actually learn more and retain the concepts better when I solo code myself.

I would appreciate the lectures being laser focused and then the students/teachers asking questions that might lead to tangents doing so at the end.

Also, I enjoy thinking about what I'm learning at a bunch of random points during my day (eg while I'm in the shower).  Last week, I found it incredibly easy to go over things I learned and practice writing code in my mind.  This week, I found it more difficult.  I have two guesses as to why.  The first is that I occasionally struggled to see how some of the challenges related to the OO theme for the week.  For example, for a challenge like 'reading CSV', why was the shell code written as classes and how would it look if the program was procedural?  This left me wondering, why is this difference significant?  Because of this, I think my mind was focusing on structuring the world around me instead of concentrating on what I'm learning.  My second guess is that the focus of this week was slightly more broad than last week.  So whereas I might have played around with the 'map' method in my mind last week, I instead try to build a class while I'm taking a shower (proves to me much more difficult).

I realize we need some groundwork before OOP starts to entirely make sense as a concept, but I think it would have been good to talk about it from Day 1, or to have been assigned an OOP book or something as part of our prep work. At this point I'm aware of exactly how basic our prep work was, and I believe it would have made a huge difference in how confident I currently feel to have been assigned like 3 times as much with twice as long to work on it, including materials covering OOP and some of the more overarching concepts. I wanted to start preparing 4 months in advance, but had little idea of where to direct my learning, and feel like without any guidance I chose poorly. Prep felt like a bit of a rush job, on both the DBC end and my end.

Huge fan of going over in a group a few of the prior challenges, either as code review or someone doing the problem from scratch, gives good insight into other approaches and/or best practices. 

Loved having the Chicago group here, it was awesome to have even more people helping out and they were very solid teachers. Dave's talk was insightful as someone who's essentially been in our shoes. A night where my pair's mentor (who is a developer) was in and helped us work through the hospital problem was very very useful, both on logic and just having someone to ask questions in the evening. For future reference if there is any way to get a collection of mentors for the cohort who could come in one evening every 3 weeks or something, that would be very helpful.

I've gotten to a point where I want to choose who I pair with.  Pairing with Eno on Wednesday was detrimental to my week and the exercises I had to execute the following day.  Not only did Eno leave me in the dust with the exercises since he prefers to code without me, but he gave me feedback on me strengthening my fundamentals, which wasn't even delivered in a kind way.

Now I'm filling out my survey and sitting across from Ryan Mosser who has made it SO OBVIOUS these last 2 weeks that he doesn't want to pair with me.  He expressed resentment and judgement towards me again when I was assigned to him for this group project.  He blatantly said, ""I think Khara is supposed to be in Short Ryan's group.""  Ryan doesn't even make eye contact with me.  It makes me so angry/fearful to work with people that act as a hindrance to my personal growth and interfere with my ability to code.

I am so resentful, because I remember experiencing something similar with Gavin and John from the summer cohort.  It's like, ""Why does it have to be this way?  Why can't I just pair with people who mutually want to pair with me?""  That's how it would be in a work environment upon being hired.  I would never decide to work somewhere where there were engineers I had to pair with that I didn't want to pair with.

Secondly, what's the message DBC is trying to relay - Get things done or learn?  If the priority could be made more clear to me by staff that would be great.  To me, it's learning as much as I can, but I gather from students it's learn as much as you can by get things done.  When it's the ladder, it creates poor pairing experiences because when I act entitled to my learning experience pairs like Eno and Ryan  M want to separate so they can charge ahead.

Lastly, although I appreciate Shereef's concern, I don't understand the manner of emailing me a second time once I have already been contacted by one other staff member.

I didn't feel the same lows as I did over the past 2 weeks, not because I knew the subject better, on the contrary I didn't know anything about SQL and barely scratched the surface of activerecords. But what changed was how I felt going home at the end of the day. I've learned to just accept that what I've done is good enough and be happy with the progress I've made.

I had a short talk with Anne at the start of the week about how I freaked out over the weekend. I was worried that the progress I was making was not good enough or I didn't have a good enough handle on the concepts. I really appreciated that we were able to talk and she set a lot of my fears and anxiety to rest. I can't say enough about how great all the instructors have been and I'm always so thankful for their kind and generous support. 

I feel like I'm slowly building up my confidence which benefits not only me but I think the people around me as well as I can share my ideas and that might inspire some new direction in the challenge we are working at on hand. It might, it might not but at least I put it out there. I don't want to come across like I don't want to share what I know which is really never what I want to do.

I'm very glad that you decided to split up the teams for us because I think it might have been skewed if you didn't. I feel like you should also do that for pairing so we don't have to worry about who we are going to ask to pair with.

The highest points for me this week were two different occasions of one-on-one time with more experienced programmers. On Tuesday night, I sat down with my mentor Jeff Smith for about and hour and went through some of his side projects. He's more interested in front end and design, so it was awesome to really dive into some cool javascript concepts and learn about responsive web design. The other instance was with Keith on Wednesday night. I was having problems with certain git nuances, and had spent many hours to trying to figure it out on my own.

I feel there could be a bit more of context/background/overview set before we learn about new concepts like activerecord. It seems to come in piecemeal which can be frustrating. I know there's no chance of absorbing the whole thing at once but even just getting a frame like 'ActiveRecord is a Module with many Classes, but we're going to first focus on two of them, Base and Migrate' would have been super helpful. Then as I learn bits and pieces I at least know a general sense of where to put them. I think this would help me retain more of what I learn. Kind of like a thesis statement for the day.

Having the teachers keep pestering us to remember to do it is really helpful. 
I felt like we were intentionally dropped in the deep end with the databases/ active record stuff and it was incredibly rewarding to feel like I was capable of swimming. I didn't finish all the challenges on thursday but I feel capable of doing so, it's just a question of time and plugging away at it, which hasn't necessarily been the case with all the prior challenges. Breaking my database and being able to go back with git, put it back together, and moving forwards to get it working added to my confidence level in that realm. I think it was hard for the students who hadn't worked with git before to try to incorporate that; some sort of quick walkthrough probably would have helped a lot of people.
I really, really enjoyed this week. I enjoyed databases, I felt like teachers and students have settled into a bit of a groove, lectures were useful, we're pretty much all working well together. I also want to note and thank the teachers who stuck around in the evenings to give some extra help, I'm sure you guys would like to have a life outside of here and it means a lot that you are willing to give even more of your time to help us learn. We probably don't say it enough because it feels a little bit like sucking up, but thank you so much for your dedication to teaching and to us and to making this a worthwhile experience. I think the thing I'm feeling the most right now is gratitude, for the chance to work with and learn from this really excellent group of people. This has been the best learning experience with the best group collectively of my life.
Interviews were seriously stressful. I didn't think I was exceedingly nervous going in, but being under time pressure and having to code on a whiteboard instead of a keyboard was very very stressful. I definitely panicked, and made stupid mistakes on things I knew. I know we had a certain time crunch in the prior weeks but we could kind of work through things at our own pace, or go back to them and figure out our sticking points in the evening, so having to do X in X timespan felt very different.

One negative thing that I have to say about the learning experience at DBC is that we are kind of feedback machines. We give feedback to our peers, to the program, to the speakers, to the teachers, ... But on the other hand the only feedback that we receive is from other students.

We haven't receive any feedback from the two weekend assessments, I personally haven't receive any personal form any of the teachers.

I really didn’t like the joke we played on Sherrif. Makes me still feel bad when I think about it.  I also don't like that you told us that his talk will be later that day at 5pm but than just canceled it without telling anyone. If you want to change the schedule twice a day that is one thing but at least tell everyone.     An unrelated suggestion would be to have an email or something where we can send random suggestions on how to improve DevBootcamp. I’m sure there would be a gem in it once in a while.   2 ideas from me: 1.     Make sure the panic button at the front door is labeled as that more prominent. 2.     Consider changing your “Now start the prep work” email with regard to the time required. One might plan accordingly and thus underestimate the real time needed which in my case would have been > 100 hours (my fault to interpret the email the way I wanted but why not be on the safe side and make sure it can not be misunderstood).   What I really don’t like is that you did not mention the whole “we might kick you out after 3 or 6 weeks” thing before DevBootcamp started. You seem to take pride in not grading but what else is this test? If you fail (= get an f) you will be kicked out? For some people who didn’t know about that beforehand and who might not be able to extend their time (due to visa issues or other arrangements), having to repeat three weeks and being kicked is basically the same thing.  What now follows might be only due to me not getting enough sleep the last couple of days but thinking of the iceberg you’ll get it all and raw anyway.  I really don’t like the whole testing stuff (see above). Indepent from if I’ll make it or not or if I can extend my stay or not it just makes me feel very bad and is a HUGE distraction (for me). It’s hard to estimate but I currently guess that I lost close to a whole day of productivity just by thinking of the test, again and again and therefore could not sleep and therefore being tired… On top of that comes what it does to my mood. I disliked the test idea as soon as I heard about it (which I think was far to late -> see above) but it really kicked in this week. What adds to my not liking the test stuff is that I don’t get the point off it. I don’t want to learn how to learn with such kind of pressure. Maybe it will help some other people on how to approach interviews and stuff but it just doesn’t work for me. I would have liked to practice interviews without them being combined with this whole ‘we might kick you out afterwards’ thing since I approach real job interviews very different than I approached this test today. There are potentially thousands of companies I can apply to so if one rejects me it’s not that big off a deal. On the other hand I will not be able to join such a program again for the foreseeable future (due to time, money and visa issues) so it feels like much more is at stake than it would be in an job interview. Bla, bla, bla, I think you get my point.  I do see that you have to look out for the people who fall behind and that it might not be a good idea for some to continue but why not use all of the information you have about us, all the feedback we got from our pairs… and once you get the feeling that someone might not fit in / falls to far begin speak to him/her, speak to him/her again, maybe get an outsider to speak to him her and than suggest to repeat some of the program? Why does it all have to be on one day where a lot of people just feel like shit, couldn’t sleep (and had to get up even earlier), get freaked out by stage fright… You have more experience than I but I just don’t see how this is supposed to add to an optimal learning environment.  Again this might be about some skill some people are interested in but I’m not. I can’t remember when the last time was I needed it (even when changing jobs) and since I really don’t like practicing it under realistic conditions I really wished that this would not be part of Devbootcamp.  Alright, that’s it. I’m sure I don’t need to tell you that this is just an unfiltered rand of some sleep-deprived dude who is just disappointed at himself. I really enjoyed my time here until this Wednesday and obviously some bad days are expected. So I kind of expect that everything will be better next week (in case I make it). Besides I really love the general setup, all the teachers, the other students and a lot of the things you are doing here. I also acknowledge that you have to deal with a very diverse bunch of students from different backgrounds, with different prior skill levels, different intelligence… so you can not make it work for all the people all the time. So it didn’t really work for me the last couple of days but I’m still optimistic that it won’t be like this for the rest of the program (and the other students).  ",Basti,Sea Lions

I would prefer to have a bit more solo time, especially as we're addressing brand new topics.

Each morning we spent 1.5 hrs in a talk or lecture and then have 1.5 hrs or so to code. After lunch, there's another 1h -1.5hr lecture and then coding for 3-4 hours before most of the instructors leave. I feel a bit overwhelmed with all the challenges and projects I have, and not being able to dive and actually get stuff done. I think the lectures are helpful, but they need to be more focused and much shorter. Sometimes I think the lecture just drags on and it becomes an open forum for people to just talk about whatever for however long. 

I also feel a bit frustrated having to ""do over"" some activities such as Wednesday empathy and the check in intro with the banana slugs. With all the work we have, every hour counts and having to sit through an hour of something I've already done seems a bit wasteful.

I've been thinking a lot about my ""optimal learning"", and how I learn the most and the fastest. For me personally, I learn the most and fastest when I'm solo-ing. I look forward to every Thursday because I not only get the most amount of work done this day compared to any other day, but I also fully understand the material and learn the most. I would really like to be able to solo more often. I realize that being able to explain to someone how to do something truly validates understanding, however when I'm personally learning something completely foreign and brand new with someone else, it's difficult to move at the same pace. When I'm able to solo, learn something and get something working, I'm actually more motivated to get up and go help someone else with the newfound knowledge I've figured out. Going further with this concept, I feel like it's a bit unfair to be forced to help the other cohort for an hour out of my day when I only have 4-5 hours of coding time in the day, especially on the solo day when I'm learning the most.

As the scope of what we don't know becomes more and more evident I am questioning the 9 week format as too short. I recognize there is this huge emphasis on learning to learn and I absolutely recognize the long-term value there, but in terms of requisite skills to be able to build stuff and demonstrate actual technical competence in an interview situation, 9 weeks seems a bit absurd.

I am not clearly not as experienced as others in my cohort, and I feel at a disadvantage because of that. The ""live"" environment as opposed to working on exercises alone prior to bootcamp was a little unsettling to me and I found that I was not always able to recall things I had learned previously or contribute as much as I would have liked to. I am a beginner, but I feel the bootcamp expects a higher level of previous experience than comprehension than I have. I would like to have more lecture time going over material rather than going right into the challenges and figuring it out at that moment, which is stressful and puts me into panic mode. I spend more time trying to learn and understand the material during the challenge, which generally results in me not finishing them by the end of the day, which of course leads to late nights trying to catch up. I feel there isn't enough time to complete the challenges, and as days go by, I have more and more to finish. I was also quite sick this week (food poisoning I think), which kept my energy and focus pretty low. I wasn't really able to eat for a few days either, which didn't help. The bootcamp format is new to me, but I very much like the teachers and how helpful they are. I think I would prefer a longer bootcamp with less late nights; I wish i could come home and see my kids and play with them a little bit to refresh myself, but haven't had a chance to do that. I miss them deeply! I'm doing my best and look forward to catching up and moving into the next phase where I might be a little more comfortable with the material that the Lions are currently working on (HTML/CSS).

Whenever one of our teachers takes my help request, I feel like I am learning lots but being evaluated for passing into phase 3.

The 9 weeks is intense and it's an artificial high-stress environment, I feel like maybe DBC is trying to do too many things in such a short period of time. I wish I had the time to attend all the engineering empathy talks but again, time is precious and I'm hard pressed to use those 3 hours to attend a talk when I am behind in the class. I also wish I had more time to dive deeper into challenges but as it is, I'm doing my best just to keep up and I worry that this makes me look like I'm loafing when I'm not because others in my cohort have done so much more.  

I wish I could say that I enjoyed myself this week but the stress levels have taken precedence and it's hard for me to sit back and not stress when we have assessments looming and I worry about not passing the phase 3 assesment.

Although giving advice on what else to do doesn't help that much without giving advice on what not to do since I can't put in more hours I need to stop doing something in order to focus more on another thing. I would also like it if you could specify what ""behind"" means even more. Behind like you will have a harder time than others to find a job or behind like you will not make it to the next phase if you don't catch up.

I also had a hard time to understand why George had to be looked at by everybody although he clearly didn't want to do it. Sherif most likely wanted to comfort him when he smiled at him when he stared to cry but I would suggest to talk about why you are doing it in order to make sure nobody gets it the wrong way (even with the best intention I'm not a 100% convinced that this is such a great thing to do).

I also really don't like that I'm optimizing my behaviour to the tests (3 weekly assessment) and would love to take part in the empathy stuff but I feel that I will risk to move on to the next phase if I don't put in every waking hour to try to understand the technical stuff. My written feedback from the weekly assessment didn't mention that I need to catch up on the empathy stuff but on the technical stuff, group project... Also a lot of the other sea lions also din't go to the empathy thing so I felt I will fall even further behind in comparison to them if I spend this  3 hours like they do.

Still quite sceptic about the whole test thing in general. Besides me at least 2 other people are really stressing out about that and I don't see how that contributes to the optimal learning environment. I understand the reasons behind it better than during week three but loosing almost 25% of our group after phase one gives me the impression that something is wrong with the process (of course our cohort might be an outlier). If it goes one like this you really need to inform students about that not only the minute they get accepted but in bold letters on your website.

Also the teachers seemed to be very stretched on solo day. You ask us to ask for help more often but if you wait more than an hour for the next teacher to give you his attention this sounds not like very actionable advice (I posted it on socrates and put up several pink slips).

Overall I still think that this is an amazing program though but it probably could be even better if you iron out the edges and explain even more (often) why you do certain things and why you might not be able or don't want to do others.",Basti,Sea Lions

It makes a huge difference when the teachers know what they're going to lecture on in the AM: a) it's something specifically we all want to learn/are struggling with and b) they have time to prepare so it's more organized/more effective use of time. 

Just want to say that I'm really enjoying both JEffrey and Shadi. Diff style from phase 1 and diff style from Brick/Anne but I feel like this week we all kind of got into a groove with them. This week was challenging material and I feel like I learned SO MUCH even if it was 80% of what they'd like us to get. There's a certain switching cost to getting new teachers for only 3 week chunks; adapting to different people's approaches and just getting comfortable working with them definitely made last week less efficient than it could have been. I don't know if we're going to switch again for phase 3 but I would happily continue with them. 

I second maybe doing engineering empathy Fri night or perhaps Sat afternoon. Wednesday is hard because we're in the middle of the weekly grind so it IS time away from trying to master new material and it IS likely to be emotionally draining in one way or another. It's hard to do that when you're trying to finish stuff from the day and know you have to get up the next day and get thru a full day of challenges and new content. Going into the weekend it would be more manageable; gives a little more chance to process what comes up and decompress. 

Sherif (in addition to Shereef) totally called us out on not helping the slugs enough so I'm going to call him out on shaming us. Being super honest here, I want to help them. I want to get to know them as individuals, and I think we mostly all feel that way. The people aspect of this has been one of the more surprising and rewarding elements of this, in terms of what a collection of truly decent human beings are here and how much I've enjoyed working with them. But we're doing these big challenges that can easily be 6, 7 hour chunks to complete (it's like every day has turned into group project day) and when I'm barely keeping my head above water with what's going on with my app, it's such a huge switching cost. If I was more comfortable with what I was working on, which I essentially never am given how much more there is to master each day, the switch from one back to the other would be much easier. I don't know how to solve that for you guys. I think previous cohorts are the ideal people to have helping out, I've worked with a few of them and they've been incredibly helpful. 

Not sure what the current status of hypothetical phase 4 is, but if it happens I'm in. TAing at that point sounds distinctly more manageable.

And for Jeffrey, I am having fun being here on the whole even if sometimes specific chunks of the struggle are not fun in that moment. Seriously, so glad I'm here. Thank you all so much for all your effort and patience with us. ",sarah,Sea Lions

Engineering empathy felt a bit awkward this week. It seemed like there was a competition between Shereef and Steve for who was leading the group and it felt really distracting.

Specifically, it was unclear what I was expected to do with the provided code, if anything. Should we have put all our classes into one file, or were they supposed to be broken up? How much of the code was placeholder text we were expected to replace and how much were we supposed to implement? I asked and got some answers, but I still need to go back and finish it. It's a little frustrating to spend more time trying to understand the objectives and directions than it is planning my program and coding.

Of course, keeping in mind that these challenges are still early versions, and how challenging it must be to write and edit them, I'm impressed by how well thought-out most of the others are at this point!

The conversation about interviewing skills provoked a lot of emotions in me today.

I was feeling really good on Monday; I was getting it!, but that set me up for reality by Tuesday afternoon. At that point I got behind in my challenges and didn't feel I had the basis of understanding to tackle them or contribute as much as I would have liked.

I am wondering if there might be a way to review the material/challenges towards the end of each day, like from 5-6pm, or perhaps formulate a study group for those who need something like that from like 6-7pm or whatever. After 6pm, there may not be teachers available or not as easy to get help. I think I recall something like this in high school after the end of the day. Students could bring up blocks or other questions to help them move on, or just lecture more on the concepts and solidify them. Basically, moving the code reviews from the next morning to the late afternoon might be more helpful. Because by the next morning, if you're still stuck, it's a little too late because at that point you have a new set of challenges and it just builds over the week.

Another idea is to maybe have a couple mentors come by each night to help out. Not personal mentors, but for anyone who is working at night. I really like my mentor (Guillaume) and he is super helpful, but I seriously could use him every night!

I also like the idea of moving the Engineering Empathy sessions to Friday nights. This past Wednesday I was already so behind that I couldn't even think of going to the session.

Lastly, I understand the purpose of the weekly assessments, but they are very stressful in themselves. I wish we could really use the weekends to focus on completing challenges and catching up, either in the office with others or perhaps meeting up with our mentors, etc. The assessment, on top of completing all  of the challenges is nearly impossible to  pull off. It's enough to worry about the upcoming phase assessment  as it is!

Other than that, I actually had a little ""fun"" yesterday working on flash cards. I used Weds night to brush up on my understanding of OO and it definitely helped me on Thursday. I didn't finish it, but I'm close, and I also liked that it was a solo day, so I could work at my own pace to really try and understand every little piece of what was going on.

With that thought, maybe solo day should be Monday? Maybe that would help us learn the material solidly so we have a better foundation going into the rest of the week.

If all teachers are busy, that's ok, but it seems like sometimes they are in the offices and not out on the floor. And I don't think anyone feels very comfortable interrupting the teachers when they're in the offices, even if that's what we're ""supposed"" to do, which I'm not sure it is anyway.

Also, would there be any way to have at least a little access to the teachers at the DBC office on the weekends? Not as much as during the week of course, but there are several of us here on Saturdays and Sundays, and it would really be helpful to have a teacher or two swing by for at least a couple hours.

A note on the speakers: So far, I've attended all of them, but haven't felt that they've benefitted me all that much. If that could be addressed by the staff, I think that would be helpful, but from this point forward it feels like my time would be better spent coding and trying to keep up with the material than listening to a speaker on Thursday night.

I also want to say that I disagree that my best learning environment is in the learning/panic edge. The times that I've felt the most energized, happy, and excited about what I'm doing is when I feel like I'm in my ""learning zone"".

I guess it's like driving, if we have a map and no instructions apart from the destination, we can figure our way around. Buildings will change, roads might change but the overall layout remains pretty much the same and if you have a good idea of that, you can better piece and connect the moving parts to each other. 

I also wish we dove deeper into Javascript. Partly because I find it very interesting but also because I felt we didn't get enough time. I wish we also spent more time on APIs and developing a sense of how to create a useful app. But I suppose that is something that is not specifically technical though it would have been interesting to maybe have a speaker come in who's made many popular apps to talk about how s/he goes about thinking up of apps, their thought process, how they plan to market it, how they decide their target audience, etc.

re: prepwork... I spent a considerable amount of time learning and studying Ruby before coming to DBC, so coming even on the first day, I had at least seen similar code before which I think made the learning experience more comfortable than other people who didn't spend as much time preparing. During phase 2, we were introduced to Javascript, and it felt like jumping into the deep end with my floaties. It took me longer to pick up on the concepts, and was actually harder for me to learn. I found doing all the codeschool jQuery tutorials and reading some background, helped me gain some back foundation so that I actually had or knew of the tools to use when answering the exercises. I would recommend that every student completes all the ruby + css + jquery courses on codeschool before coming here, even if they have no idea what was going on. Just being exposed to the material and seeing it helps me learn when I try to implement and actually understand it.

I noticed that Shadi and Jesse are consistently reminding us that we have a lot to learn and that we are all doing okay and not to freak out so that has been good to know and I think eases a lot of anxiety we have.

Showing up in the three key areas is tough to gauge. I am trying on all three, but it feels like a learned skill in ways. I've not paired before and so I struggle with working past hiccups in the process with another person. I am working hard to notice any instances in which I slip up on any of the three fronts, to be aware and try to make changes. With other people in the GBears I see what I perceive to be a similar experience. 
I'm not very sure how to answer how much I have learned or where I spent the most time in terms of learning zones. I feel as though I am absorbing a fair amount, but in the moments of confusion that counter resets to zero (more of an emotional reaction). It's a hard balance, but I am trying to navigate it well.  
The structure is good... The schedule is VERY full, which I understand is the point, but I feel as though if were longer chunks of uninterrupted coding time in the morning I might benefit from that. I certainly understand there are logistical constraints on that (schedules, reviewing previous days code, laying out sched for the day) but for me, the mornings are my wake-up fresh, I've slept on a problem and usually woke up dreaming about it and am ready to dive into some code. Perhaps the answer to that lies more in me restructuring my mornings to allow for personal coding time individually. 
Thanks for answering that question for me, Hannah. 
You're welcome, Hannah.

All in all this is an awesome time. It's definitely intense, but I feel like you guys have optimized feedback loops to fine-tune this process every time you create a new instance of the Cohort class.

I'm sure I'm not the first person to make the ""too much pair coding"" argument, but here goes- For me there seems to be two pieces to my process: working on the problem conceptually, and then working on implementing.  I have found, thus far, that I feel comfortable with the conceptual portion before some of my partners, and as a result, I'm ready to get going with implementation when they're still working on conceptualizing the problem.  It frustrates me, because the time consumed in this eats up time for things like stretch problems, where the conceptual element is very difficult, but that's the part I'm really interested in.  The most fun assignment was Quad, even though it was super late, and I was fried, because it requires a lot of time just staring at it.  I realize real world coding requires an ability to work with others and communicate your ideas with others in a meaningful way, but personally, I would prefer more of a balance between solo/pairs.",Conor,Golden Bears

For example, once during a pairing session, I felt that my pair was resisting my urge to put the sticky note up and get clarification on certain things - and I wanted to ask a teacher, because my pair was not explaining the answer in a way that I could understand. In a way, I felt I was on a completely different thinking level than my pair and at times, I couldn't follow their logic even though it was correct. 

I think I would benefit from a smaller, one on one type of question and answer session when there is a problem, I don't understand. And for the most part, I have been able to create this one on one environment with a pair that I can easily understand and follow. But when I find my pair hard to understand, when and how, can I pull myself out of that situation and find someone who I can more fully understand  without offending my pair or deserting them for the help of another. 

I felt I was wasting time at certain points, when I felt I could be spending it learning the answer to a problem that in return I could then come back to my pair and be more of a help because I had now gained that clarification. (When the pair is unable to clarify.)

Things I love! ---
I really enjoyed the check-in exercise. I was reassuring to know that others are having the same feelings and that the anxiety/nervousness was shared across the board. It was also helpful to know that other, more advance, cohorts are still struggling with the drowning feeling and that it isn't an abnormal feeling. 

Things that could change---
While Zee is a great teacher and presenter, I feel that because he is so advanced in regard to keyboard shortcuts and maneuvers on the screen, that it can be difficult at times to follow what he is doing. For example, when he is testing and making very fast changes on the screen, I think it would be beneficial to some, if that process was slowed down a bit. I am glad to not see VIM used during presentations. 

That's all! 

Thanks for reading and allowing me to voice my opinions.

I really enjoyed talking about the importance of feedback and how to pair efficiently.  However, when it comes to coding, I would have liked the teachers to be more available, just even as a check in to see if my logic was sound.  This is easier when I'm partnered with stronger people because I'm able to receive feedback more quickly and accurately, but we have a mix of abilities with our cohort.

Here's my thoughts:

1. I think there are too many core exercises.  I end up rushing in order to get through them all on time.  Ideally they'd be reduced by a third.  Part of the problem is #2...

2. The exercise instructions could be a lot more clear and consistently displayed so that we understand exactly what is expected. I wish I had the time to put on my PM hat and spec this out to show you what I mean but I'm swamped :)

3. It would be a lot easier if pairs were chosen methodically.  You may have reasoning towards letting us choose ourselves but it would be more efficient to have assignments. 

4. The staff is wonderful.  I dislike the ice-breaking exercises immensely but I understand their importance.  I don't have a suggestion other than I wish they didn't involve so much personal sharing, at least on the first day.  I think there's too much pressure to make a good impression.

5. I love Dev Bootcamp and would have paid more tuition than I did (not a suggestion though).  I’m very happy to be a part of it.""

I felt unprepared and overwhelmed and out of place. Not in terms of Ruby or the challenges, but in terms of logistics and figuring boring housekeeping stuff out. I understand why we were told to ask the other cohorts stuff like where the bathroom is and how to get a locker, but the problem is we don't know what we don't know, if that makes sense. You don't know that there are 2 different codes to the doors until you get locked out. In defense of the other cohorts, Monday already feels like so long ago, for them it must feel like a million years. We're so focused on being here, existing here, it's easy to forget what life is like outside of this place, so it's easy to forget what people need to know when they're new. I finally found the student handbook, ""Socrates/Labs"" is the last place I looked for it. For me, that's not a very intuitive place to keep that. I would have really liked to have been able to read that before Monday. Monday was so overwhelming with the people and the challenges, that having to figure out the minutiae of whether there would be space in the fridge for my lunch just really stressed me out.
As terrible and dejected as I felt at the end of the day Monday, I woke up Tuesday morning feeling great. I realized that I feel pretty confident that I can work through any problem, eventually. Tuesday and Wednesday both were amazing. Particularly, on Wednesday, I had a super fun time pairing with Zee for part of a challenge. It would be really cool if everyone got to pair with a teacher for some small thing. It helped that I was pairing with Zee, since he's so much fun and nice. I find the Shereef&Sherif a little intimidating. Or at least, I still did on Wednesday. Which is silly because they are very nice. I'm working on it.
Thursday was tough. I felt like a failure for not being able to finish the core challenges. But at the same time I liked that I could not stop thinking about Boggle. Instead of feeling frustrated and defeated, I felt like I was really close and I just needed to step back and come back to the problem with a clear head. I think finding that sweet spot where I'm no longer producing anything useful and before I hit my breaking point is going to be hard for me.
I really like yoga. On Wednesday I was excited to go, because I felt good about the amount I had accomplished in the morning. On Friday I didn't want to go because I was worried about the Sudoku Solver. But once I got there on Friday I was glad to have gone and I felt much calmer when I came back.
The check-in was interesting. I think I liked it. I like having a place where I can just dump my feelings, since by the end of each day I'm so wound up. The part that made me uncomfortable was listening to other people's feelings. I don't know, I think I felt embarrassed to be listening? Like I was eavesdropping or like since these people would never tell me these things in person, that listening would be imposing. I'm not sure. I'm reserving judgement. 
I liked Jesse's talk on Thursday. It was super interesting and made me realize that I have a lot of my self worth wrapped up in my perception of my own intelligence as well. It really has a huge affect on my mood. So that's something I need to work on. 
I would love to see a weekly calendar with like check ins, yoga, speakers, just all the phase independent (or even some phase dependent stuff, like monday morning: phase 1 individual checkins with teachers). Just a loose outline. There's so much going on it's hard to remember what happens on what day.

If we could get exercises that let us actually do the point of the challenge quickly, that would be helpful. 

The Wednesday talk was not very helpful. I don't dismiss the fact that there is sexism and I too don't agree with it but I think we talked at too high a level, abstract level of it. It would have been better to have more concrete examples like things that happen at the work place, etc. Having examples or real life context makes things easier to understand. The engineering empathy nights that I have attended have both felt like we talk a whole bunch, then that's it. I don't expect to be given an answer but we are given a situation/context and we talk at length about it and when it ends, it feels like, ok that's it.

I want to continue going to the talks, but I think the staff should be more aware of the potential negative aspects of such a long talk on the students - we don't even get 3.5 hours with our teachers on most days. If that time schedule needs to be retained, then I think Steve, Shereef, et al should definitely heed the vast amount of feedback about making that empathy talk more valuable, e.g. give us a little more intellectual/social credit and not treat us like middle schoolers at an assembly.

I felt badly about skipping and I would have felt badly had I chosen the other option (knowing how crummy it feels to feel lost). The midweek thing is just really, really bad timing. I truly do want to do engineering empathy and it always feels like a rock and a hard place. Additionally, maybe 3+ hrs is too long? If it could happen in 2 hrs, I think it would be a more manageable option time-wise. 

Seriously, do Jeffrey's git presentation sooner. It makes no sense to be doing it at the end of phase 2 week 2. Do it at the end of phase 1, if not sooner. 

The thing about this phase is that unless both people in a pair are moving fast, you often don't get to the ajaxify it part of challenges. It's easy to not actually end up doing much ajax or JS. I think it would be really helpful for a lot of people to turn one of these mini-apps like flicker or hacker news into a 1.5 or 2-day project and make the ajax component mandatory. I know group projects kind of fulfill this role, but more would be better.

Thurs night speakers were generally great. Super real, and gave some solid advice. I do want to note (and I personally don't care, and have no interest in noting it further than this feedback form) that they definitely made a dick joke, and given the context of stuff going on in the larger tech community this week it was weird. This may well have been addressed in this week's engineering empathy session (in which case my mistake) but people here are kind and respectful. It's a protective bubble. Amongst all the soft skills we've been working on, I'm not sure how much we've touched on how to deal with and work with those people who act like flat-out assholes, who aren't receptive to feedback, who behave in ways that violate general social norms, etc.

I'm really, really enjoying phase 2 this time around. I feel like I solidly grasp the foundation now, and it's so much easier/faster to learn/build new stuff on top of it.

I enjoyed the first day of TreeGrove and personally wish I had the time to sit down with a teacher to discuss what went right and what went wrong.  I think the pieces that I might have executed sub-optimally on TreeGrove (Day 1), were never resolved, and accumulated my increasing frustration with the other OO challenges.  I'm 80% of the way there to understanding OO Design and Modeling, but I felt that had there been more time (w/o distraction from mock interviews, wednesday empathy, etc) to code and encounter these problems during the hours that the teachers are available, I would have felt more comfortable with the material.  The break outs also focused on the theory, rather than specific syntax implementation which was where I struggled.  I know that you can pull out pieces to handle the UI or output interface, but I don't know HOW to do that.  I have no clear picture on how to execute that.  I wish there was some sample code that the teachers have already looked at, and already know how to BEST optimize it, and that we could all get a chance to refactor it and compare it to the teachers' refactoring.  

Zee is incredibly talented and he did make the effort to break down some refactoring, specifically for 'single responsibility' and 'separation of concerns', but the methods that he implemented were far beyond my ability at this point.  Therefore the whole exercise was lost and my questions were still unresolved.  I fear that if this knowledge gap isn't closed, it will accumulate my anxiety into next week.  I understand that the goal isn't to understand everything, but that doesn't ease my concern as, naturally, things will become increasingly difficult as time goes on.  There isn't enough time in the day to have individual questions resolved by a mentor/teacher.  Ideally, it would be amazing to go over an entire, already-completed, challenge with a mentor, and be given pointers on how to optimize it further.  At this point, I'm afraid that if I don't start getting direction on how to improve my style, my style will never change.",Wayne Yang,Golden Bears

It's proving to be so because all the people in my cohort who had previous experience with other languages or background on Ruby are able to keep the pace and flow with the experience, whilst noobs like me are always a tad behind at every point. I would hope that dbc has a human side and that it's not all about money and business but I've been burned by that hope from for profit companies way to much in the past. Not sure what to think at this point.

I would say that our cohort is about split. 45% are advanced with backgrounds in something that has made their process smoother. 10% are in the middle ground and another 45% of us are noobs. It would make sense given the business model that it's only beneficial to have someone complete dbc if they are likely to get a job through the hiring day/program. 

I guess there is a bit of a feeling of being hustled, like as if the model of the program changed to be more directed to getting advanced users in and weeding out the noobs.

This had a couple of ramifications. First, there was a big time gap between those that went first and those that went last. I was one of the last, so I didn't receive my feedback until 4 or 5pm on Wednesday. Since this was a particularly important check-in in terms of preparing for assessments today, it felt a little unbalanced that some people had almost an extra day and a half to reflect on that feedback. Second, it meant that Brick and Zee weren't able to field help requests for almost 2 full days. 

Beyond that, I'm not sure the weekend assessments totally work. It's great to get feedback and know where you stand, but it's rough not having teachers on the floor for two days. Also the format is so different from the phase assessments, that I'm questioning how much the weekend work is prepping us for that. Unfortunately, I don't have an ""actionable"" suggestion here so it may be a good thing for us to talk about as a group.

I haven't had a bad pairing session since week one till yesterday (thursday) and it made the whole day go south. I was paired with a more advanced pair that when asked to slow down for me became condescending. The way they handled the pairing was by going 3,000 miles per hour with no regard for me even though I asked for a slower pace and more involvement. It was as if I wasn't even there. It felt almost show-off-y. We were doing our first real dip into Active Record and being paired with this person definitely affected my learning. My confidence sunk to zero.

I really appreciated brick and zee giving us a high level overview of the challenges this week. I feel like it made things a bit easier in a good way to then dive into the challenges. It would be great if that could keep going.

One thing that I have noticed and has come up in conversation with a few others, is that, at times, it seems that there may not be enough teachers to students. 

Sometimes I find it hard to understand the explanations that Zee is giving. I am sometimes left even more confused. I know he is trying so hard to help us and to prepare us, and I am grateful of that. But, it would be nice if he could slow down at times by not typing so fast and by breaking things down into smaller concepts - and present them slowly to ensure that we are actually taking them in. I know this goes the same for the individuals who are experiencing this - we should be explaining this to Zee right when it is happening - I know a few of us have talked about be very upfront about that.

Some of the Socrates links led people astray-- I think we've corrected the particular ones this week, but in general maybe the teachers should do a quick run through of challenges to make sure the instructions aren't leading people the wrong way.

I felt the ROI on time to knowledge learned this week was relatively lower. Maybe that's inevitable as we get into bigger projects and more idiosyncratic gems / auth interfaces.

I think you should have the assessments on Thursday and spare those that have to leave some humiliation.

The whole assessment thing was nuts. I'm sure you all know this. Sorry to have not given feedback sooner, but in nearing the end of the week the stress surrounding our cohort became really overwhelming. Friday was honestly a blur. It felt really pretty terrible. I don't know if I can offer any feedback on how to alter that, but it really felt crazy to me. I remember the first day we arrived some of the previous cohort were focusing heavily on (what I hadn't realized at the time) what was their previous Friday assessment and having some of their cohort cut. I made a very concerted effort to walk away and try to focus on the positive vibe of the whole thing (which is amazing, btw), assuming that the people who were dwelling were more negative by nature. Honestly, with this past week providing insight, it feels really bad. 
The stress was amazingly high, and despite knowing that you all did what you felt was necessary and best for the group it really hurt having some of our cohort get cut.
I would be willing to have a more open conversation about this I think, so feel free to pull me aside if you would like. 
I am simultaneously very happy with the experience, the energy surrounding everything aside from the assessments is amazing... Absolutely awesome. It is inspiring and motivating and everything I need to personally thrive and remain at my peak, and I appreciate it.

One of the things I noticed today was that we don't really get as much actual instruction from Shereef. In fact, I've only gotten personal help (via sticky) once from him my past 7-8 weeks. I remember when he did OOP in phase 1 for us and it was really mind-blowing. Just feel like it would be cool to see Shereef instruct a bit more, although typing this now I realize how redundant it would be (the phase teachers themselves are definitely more than capable) and how big of a waste of his time it must be considering he has more stuff to do.

To me, my ""teachers"" are the phase teachers, but every time we get to see Shereef talk it's been a good experience and he has a lot to offer.

The rspec drills were a nice way to ramp up into testing. I mentioned this to Sherif already but it'd be really nice if there were a board somewhere indicating which Sea Lion is currently on TA duty. The live coding breakouts are awesome; being able to get insight into the thought patterns and workflow of people who know what they're doing is really valuable and something I'd love to get more of. I have some programmer friends and I will literally sit there and watch them code, even in languages I don't know. This was on the whole a really good week learning-wise.

Bad stuff - I did hartl over the weekend despite instructions to take time off and I feel like that made sliding into rails relatively comfortable, just a matter of figuring out the details of how sinatra maps to rails. However I know a lot of people in the cohort felt really dropped off the cliff, and it was hard seeing them stressed out and frustrated.

From what the lions have related, I'm not sure the actual experience of phase 4 is entirely mapping to the description of phase 4 that Sherif sent out. Might want to think about that a little as you ask for slugs to commit to phase 4.

Having the teachers come around and pair with us on solo day and get us ramped up on some trickier things was awesome. Honestly though it's always in the back of the mind whether they're doing that in an attempt to surreptitiously assess/judge. I don't actually feel anymore like all of the staff is on our side and that's a real disappointment.

I thought about this when we were doing checkins this AM - I understand why you rearranged accountability groups when Matthew & I repeated phase 2, but it was actually pretty upsetting to be removed from my original group. That was my comfortable safe space to be real and all of a sudden that was gone and I had to start from scratch again. I know a few other people have mentioned feeling similarly as people in their groups have been asked to leave or repeat; not sure what a good solution is there.

My first paragraph is a specific example of how we were not given the same preparation, and a pretty huge oversight in my opinion.  There was quite a bit of information that I could have crammed in coming into the phase had I known how much and what particular topics to cover.  Granted, I may have been able to find this out on my own by asking past cohorts.  But again, the past cohort didn't have to do this.

As discussed in the breakout, the Phase 1 assessment day was incredibly jarring for some, for others just an inconvenience.  People lost accountability partners; in some cases, their entire accountability group.  Every person I talked to that day said the same thing: ""There is no way I'll be able to work and try to block out everything else that's going on today.""  Apparently, these people missed some valuable lessons in ActiveRecord.  I like that DBC has decided to change the scheduling for the evals though.",,Golden Bears

I'm having such a great time. This is lots of fun. Engineering empathy was good. I agree with Shereef that we should be doing this more. The conversations/talks from Sherif about learning have been insightful. If I didn't have so much Ruby to work on I would be doing heaps more research on that.

I have seen a few using their phones and laptops for purposes other than taking notes and code related activities. 

This learning environment is supposed to welcome questions of all kinds and at any time. There have been a few times during a lecture when someone asks a questions that is not quite on topic and its sort of brushed aside and the teachers tell them to go try it out in IRB when the lecture is over or that they will address that with them individually. I know that this may be due to keep the lecture times down and answering questions can consume a lot of time, but I feel like it diminishes that open question asking environment that you are trying to create. 

I also think that some of these questions are relevant and other people could benefit from hearing the answers. 

Another thing that I would like to add, is that if you say screenflow is available and should be used during all lectures, can you enforce that? I think it would be very beneficial to go back and review these videos when you need a refresher on certain things. I think screenflow could be a valuable asset that isnt being taken advantage of.

I also love pairing programming and the structure of our days. However, I also feel like I have in some ways been set up to fail. I am truly a beginner so I haven't got all the basics down and we are doing crazy difficult things. I can push through and I will. But if what you want for me is the same as what I want for myself, to succeed, I think something is missing in the way the program has been set up. 

Here's one idea regarding refactoring. Refactored code can seem a ton more complex than non refactored code. I understand that we need to learn how to refactor code but wouldn't it be to your advantage to use non-refactored code when you're teaching in lecture so that those of us who are new can follow along more easily? Understanding is hard enough without that on top of it. I think refactoring can be learned closer to the end. Those people who already know how to do it can just do it but those of us who don't won't have to struggle with it right away.

I have feedback around the decision to ask people to leave and I prefer to discuss this with someone instead of writing my feedback here. I hope someone pulls me aside.

The last thing is I believe there should be some downtime for people to study. I want to succeed! And for me, especially as a newbie, means I need time to look over and study what I've done. 

I'll say again that I love the concept of Bootcamp style learning and I love writing code and the exercises you provide us. By the way the teachers are awesome. I love the silliness and play. That makes me happy. Slowing down and avoiding topics that are not so relevant to the intended lecture learning might be beneficial. 

I am writing this quickly and want to reiterate that I think this program is fabulous but I hope you take some of my ideas to heart.",Paulette Luftig,Fiery Skippers

Also, it was hard to hear when we had lectures in the meadow which made me start to daydream and not pay attention to what was going on 

It helped to show the agenda of the lecture at the beginning of the lecture today. It would be even more helpful if we could get the agenda for all the lectures for the whole week. Also would be helpful if we had an agenda for everything we're doing including yoga, check-in sessions, speakers, etc.

I really enjoyed all of the talks by Sherif.

I felt that we did way too many ice breakers on the first day. We didn't start coding till 2:30pm and we had a ton of challenges to do. This made a lot of us fall behind right off the bat which made us play catch up for the rest of the week.",SAM,Fiery Skippers

When pair programming works out this way, its a mutually beneficial and educational experience, because each person is hearing their partners suggestions.  When I find I work with someone this way, I wish I could continue working with them.

Other times, I feel like pair programming really holds me back and interrupts my ability to think logically about the problem.

i miss the structure of enforced pairing, and clearly defined challenges. it's hard to stay focused when we're not quite sure what the requirements are. plus everybody has so much going on, so it's hard.

I don't really have a problem with that, BUT if the exercises are incremental, which they kind of are, I'm not even partially good with the basics before we move on to the ""advanced"" versions of things.

IDEAS: To get us to know the other cohorts, why not pair us with them for some really ""easy"" problems each morning (Like 15 minutes) where we (Skippers) drive and explain what we're doing. They can help us with refactoring, best practices, etc. but that are not supposed to DO it for us. This way we have a little ""warm-up"" to get started and we both get to meet a new person. Now I won't feel as strange asking them for help.

I would love if you'd do more breakout sessions with the new people... I don't understand some major concepts, and struggling through code dealing with it only helps me to a point. I'd be better off if those of us who need more help, could just grab a room and get more help as a group....

 I LOVE the program so far!!! I LOVE that how much you're into feedback. This can only lead to good things. 

That said, I think it is EXTREMELY unfair that you can kick us out based on an assessment. While I think that it is great that you're protecting your brand, which I recognize is SUPER good for me. I feel like what I sacrificed to be here, including the time and money I've spent, has been dishonestly taken from me, if I am sent out. Getting some of my money back is obvious, but I'd still would feel ripped off and cheated. I plan on passing the assessment anyway, but unless people applied knowing that they would be tested and possibly kicked out, it is not morally right to do so. 

Everytime I get stuck now, instead of just being excited to get unstuck and learn from it, I start panicing extra about my fear of failure and rejection. I really look forward to hearing what you have decided about the assessments.

Balancing TAing, completing phase 4 work, looking for jobs and trying to get my personal life back on track was pretty challenging this week.  Not sure what the solution is given the short time frame we have access to Myles's brain.

I definitely could have used 1-3 days at the beginning of phase 4 to get the inital barrage of emails/cover letters off my plate before diving into phase 4 work.

Kitchen - Build more cabinets and buy another fridge! (maybe 1 fridge for each cohort?)

use TV screens around DBC to display the day's schedule? or maybe just relaxing kitten images. they are off for the most part.


I love seeing teachers reveal their personal side I makes them much more approachable!

place water cooler in closer distance and maybe people will hydrate themselves better?

Sherrifff has been really great at conveying the intentions, motivations, feedback session, assessment. Much appreciation for his calm demeaner and articulate descriptions.

Whats going on in Chicago? does that have any effect on SF?
